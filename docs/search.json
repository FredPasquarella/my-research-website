This study delves into the rapid shift from in-person to remote service delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic, analyzing written responses from 112 providers and staff at a large community mental health agency in California. Our findings highlight both the positive and negative impacts of this transition on structural changes, employee well-being, and clinical care. We hope these insights will inform strategies to better support mental health professionals in adapting to future changes in service delivery.\nCheck out all my Reseach Publications here."

Using Item Response Theory and the nominal response model, the scale was refined for optimal measurement accuracy. Correlation analysis confirmed its validity, demonstrating that the FOC scale provides a more precise and theoretically grounded measure of PSMS beliefs compared to existing tools.\n📄 Read More"

L.\n📝 Summary: This study examines the relationship between political instability, religiosity, and progressive social values, proposing a mediation model where increased political instability leads to lower progressive values via increased religiosity. Using structural equation modeling (SEM) on World Values Survey data (N = 3,881), the initial model had poor fit, but a revised version focusing on gender equality as a measure of progressiveness showed improved results. Findings suggest that greater political instability is linked to lower religiosity, contradicting expectations, while religiosity’s direct effect on gender equality was weak. The study highlights the need for more precise measures of political instability and cross-national comparisons in future research.\n📄 Read More"
