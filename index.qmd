## Latest Research

I am excited to share that my latest research, titled "[*Telemental health and remote work: An exploratory analysis of their dual impact on mental health professionals' experiences during COVID-19 stay-at-home orders*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11414-024-09925-z){target="_blank"}," has been published in the Journal of Behavioral Health Services & Research. This study delves into the rapid shift from in-person to remote service delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic, analyzing written responses from 112 providers and staff at a large community mental health agency in California. Our findings highlight both the positive and negative impacts of this transition on structural changes, employee well-being, and clinical care. We hope these insights will inform strategies to better support mental health professionals in adapting to future changes in service delivery.

## Latest Presentation

I'm pleased to share that I recently presented my latest research at the Society for [Social Work and Research (SSWR) 2025 Annual Conference](https://sswr.org/2025-conference-home){target="_blank"}, held from January 15th to 19th in Seattle, Washington.

At the conference, I showcased a poster titled "The Catch-22 of Telehealth: A Qualitative Study of Its Dual Impact on the Work Experiences and Well-being of Mental Health Professionals," which delved into the challenges and adaptations faced by providers during this significant shift in service delivery.

Additionally, I presented a paper on [Analyzing Telemental Health Service Modality Effects on Treatment Engagement Using Electronic Health Record Claims Data](assets/presentations/sswr_2025_tmh_engagement.pdf){target="_blank"}, exploring how different telehealth modalities impact client engagement.

I also shared a poster titled [Navigating Telemental Health: Provider Perceptions and Decision-Making in a Community Mental Health Setting](assets/presentations/sswr_2025_tmh_perceptions.pdf){target="_blank"}, which examined the factors influencing providers' choices and experiences in implementing telehealth services.

These studies were conducted as part of an annual research project I led during my agency's APA-accredited psychology doctoral internship program.

Engaging with fellow professionals at the conference provided valuable insights and fostered discussions on enhancing mental health service delivery in evolving contexts.
