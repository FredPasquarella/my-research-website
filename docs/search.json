This study delves into the rapid shift from in-person to remote service delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic, analyzing written responses from 112 providers and staff at a large community mental health agency in California. Our findings highlight both the positive and negative impacts of this transition on structural changes, employee well-being, and clinical care. We hope these insights will inform strategies to better support mental health professionals in adapting to future changes in service delivery.\nCheck out all my Reseach Publications here."

J.\nAbstract: The Fullerton Ontological Confusion (FOC) scale was constructed to address the issues of inconsistent theory and inadequate measurement regarding paranormal, superstitious, magical, and supernatural (PSMS) beliefs. For the FOC scale, PSMS beliefs were defined as confusions of ontology, or the misattribution of core knowledge belief categories. The FOC was empirically evaluated under an Item Response Theory framework using the nominal response model (NRM) to estimate item parameters and the Wald test to evaluate within-item category variation. Using the NRM and the Wald test, the FOC scale items were revised to yield a measure that was optimally formatted and informative. Correlational analysis was used to validate the FOC scale by testing the hypothesized relationships to theoretically related and unrelated constructs. The FOC scale was found to have a good degree of validity with most of the testable validation hypotheses being supported. Compared to the available existing measures, the FOC scale could be used as a more pure and informative measure for PSMS beliefs."

    "text": "2.2 Other Research\n\n2.2.1 A Structural Equation Model of Political Instability, Religiosity, and Progressive Values\nPasquarella, F. J. & Johnson, G. L.\nAbstract:A great deal of evidence supports the theory that political instability and religiosity are positively correlated. Moreover, religiosity has been shown to be positively related to progressive social values. No current research addresses the causal relationship between all three constructs. This paper proposes a model of complete mediation in which political instability is related to progressive values strictly through religiosity viz. increases in political instability are associated with decreases in progressive values through increases in religiosity. A structural equation model was created to confirm this hypothesis using randomly sampled data from the 2005 World Values Survey (N = 3,881). Exploratory factor analyses found that indicators for the latent factors were satisfactory. The hypothesized model was found to have poor fit. A three-factor EFA with oblique rotation indicated the presence of separate factors within Progressiveness. A revised model was tested with only Gender Equality as a form of Progressiveness. The new model attained satisfactory fit to the data. The estimated parameters fit the proposed theory with two exceptions: greater political instability was associated with lower religiosity, and the direct effect of religiosity on gender equality was quite weak. Limitations included systematic missing data, unrepresentative country proportions in the sample data, and the agglomeration of religious denominations into one measure of religiosity. Future research should utilize a more objective measure of Political Instability and attempt to look at between-country differences in the mediation model. Based on the estimated parameters, a direct feedback loop between religiosity and political instability should also be investigated."
